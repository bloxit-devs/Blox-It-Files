DESCRIPTION:

On 10/13/2023 (MM/DD/YYYY), TooRetrofied woke up and had acquired Hay Fever.
Hay Fever is known for its symptoms such as runny nose, which is what happened during the time of this incident.
After a long day of living, TooRetrofied would end up having a runny nose.
He would end up going into the Eiffel Tower, which just so happened to be where Unknownstaffmembe was at the time.
All of the sudden, TooRetrofied's nose would end up leaking mucus everywhere which was very acidic.
It would end up chemically burning and melting everything in the area. TooRetrofied's response being, "Oh, gosh golly!"
It was a sad and cruel day for Unknownstaffmembe as he got horribly burnt in the process.

NOTES:
The mucus produced seemed to be able to melt through tungsten.
